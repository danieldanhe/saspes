The main branch for version 2 is v2. Do not force push into it; please create pull requests.

This is a work in progress, so documentation files such as this and README.md are not fully fleshed out. Any help in this would be appreciated.

If you want to make a new feature, please create an issue for it and link it in your pull request.
